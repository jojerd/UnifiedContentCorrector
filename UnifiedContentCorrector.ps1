    1.2 - 3/25/2020 - Fixed XML loading behavior

.SYNOPSIS
    Corrects the Unified Content folder path so that the cleanup probe can check the directory for 
    files that need to be cleaned up and removed. This only needs to be run on Exchange 2013,2016, and 2019 servers
    if both conditions are met.
    1.) Exchange 2013, 2016, 2019 installed outside of the default installation path (example C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\v15\)
    2.) You are actively utilizing the built in Antimalware agent. If you are not, then this behavior is a non-issue.
